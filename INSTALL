##Installation preliminaries
Before you start building and installing this project, make sure you have the following packages are installed and configured:

* git
* cmake
* Stage 3.1
* OpenGL 

Make sure that Stage is configured properly and `$PKG_CONFIG_PATH` variable contains the path to the Stage directory.

##Building and installing
If you downloaded the project in zip or tar formats, unpack the archives. If you want 
to build "out of source" so that built binaries are placed outside of the source tree,
create the directory for the binaries and change into it. Otherwise, change into the project
directory. Run

	$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$INSTALL_DIR $PROJECT_PATH
	$ make
	$ make install
	
Where `$INSTALL_DIR` is the desired installation prefix and `$PROJECT_PATH` is the root directory
of the autolab-rapi project.
